# Life expectancy and GDP relationship across countries.

This is my second Pyhton project (by Codecademy data science course)
This project analyses whether there is a relationship between economic performance of a country and life expectancy of its citizens.

Project aims:
 - Has life expectancy increased during the observed period?
 - Has GDP increased during the observed period?
 - Is there a correlation between life expectancy and GDP of a country?
 - What is the average life expectancy in across the sample countries?

Countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, U.S.A, Zimbabwe
